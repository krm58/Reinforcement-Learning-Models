# Reinforcement-Learning-Models
This repository contains various computational models designed to solve reinforcement learning problems. 

### Credit Assignment
This folder contains two models, one which fits data from a credit assignment task according to a Rescorla-Wagner learning rule, and the other according to an Eligibility Trace learning rule (see Sutton & Barto, 1998). Also included is an automated learning script which allows for parameter recovery testing as well as simulation of data according to either model.
